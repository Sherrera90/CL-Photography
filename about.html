    <h3> I'm Caderina!</h3>
       <p>Iâ€™m that goofy girl who loves being behind the camera instead of in front of it.
            I will laugh with you, cry with you and make sure that your personality shines through these memories.</p>
    <p>I graduated with a degree in Biology because I've always loved science. I've always had a creative side, but was never to find what I truly loved. One day, I started playing around with my best friend's camera and I instantly fell in love. 
        I've never looked back! Through this experience, I have meet the most incredible people, taken some beautiful photos, and captured some of the best days of other people's lives. </p>
    <h3>I love everything about this life, and would love to experience it with you as well!  </h3>
